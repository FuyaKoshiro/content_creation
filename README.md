<h2>Summary</h2>
Select a YouTube channel and go.<br>
This program return HTML files having lists of English phrases that might be difficult for non-native speakers to understand.<br>

<h2>Background of the Project - Problem</h2>
As a non-native English speaker, I have encoutered tons of unfamilier terminologies when I have watched videos.<br>
I felt some problems:
<li>I cannot fully enjoy the videos themselves</li>
<li>It is troublesome to search those phrases every time</li>
<li>It would be great if I can learn some of the new phrases while just enjoying watching the videos</li>

<h2>Solutions</h2>
A solution I came up with is learning the phrases right before watching the videos.</br>
More clearly, having lists of phrases and their meanings on a website can be a solution.</br>
However, it is obviously so much works to do them manually.</br>
So by using GPT-3.5-turbo model API (ChatGPT) and coding, I thought I could automate whole process.</br>

<h2>System</h2>
Overview of the system looks like this: </br>
